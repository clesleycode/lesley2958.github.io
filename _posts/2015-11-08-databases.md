<h2> An Introduction to Databases: </h2>

Before delving into the details of different database technologies, let's begin by going over the very definition of what a database even is. 

<h3> What is a database? </h3>

A database is structured set of data - this data can include numbers, text, or any other representation of meaningful information. 

<h3> Why are databases important? </h3>

Without even knowing it, you use databases all the time. For every Google search or Facebook profile view, you're engaging with a database - the details are just hidden behind a user interface. Databases make the lives of developers easier by providing them with a structured and uniform set of data that they can then use to manipulate in anyway. 

<h3> NoSQL vs SQL: </h3>

<b> NoSQL: </b> 
<li> "Not only" SQL
<li> stores data in more than just tabular relations

Types of NoSQL databases:
<li> Document Oriented (Mongo!)
<li> Key Value
<li> Graph
<li> Column Oriented

<b> SQL: </b>
<li> Strictly relational

------------------------------
<h3> MongoDB </h3>

<b> Why Mongo? </b>
<li> Flexible!
<li> Speed - efficient indexing/storage techniques
<li> Scalability
<li> Querying

<b> Space: </b>

Because Mongo dynamically allocates and de-allocates RAM, it can be run on a small amount of RAM.

-> Stores data in BSON structure, which is stored in a collection.<br>
