<h2> An Introduction to Databases: </h2>

Before delving into the details of different database technologies, let's begin by going over the very definition of what a database even is. 

<h3> What is a database? </h3>

A database is structured set of data - this data can include numbers, text, or any other representation of meaningful information. 

<h3> Why are databases important? </h3>

Without even knowing it, you use databases all the time. For every Google search or Facebook profile view, you're engaging with a database - the details are just hidden behind a user interface. Databases make the lives of developers easier by providing them with a structured and uniform set of data that they can then use to manipulate in anyway. 

<h3> What is SQL? </h3>

SQL is the standard computer language for relational database management. An important property of SQL is <b>RDBMS</b>, Relational Database Management System, which means it stores its data in tables of columns and rows.   

<h3> What is NoSQL? </h3>

NoSQL, or "not only" SQL, stores data in more ways than just the traditional tabular relations. 

<h3> What are some types of NoSQL? </h3>
<li> <b>Document Oriented:</b> pairs each key with a document, which can contain many different key-value or key-array pairs.
<li> <b>Key Value:</b> 
<li> <b>Graph</b>
<li> <b>Column Oriented</b>

<h3> Why use NoSQL over SQL? </h3>

<h3> What is MongoDB? </h3>

MongoDB is document oriented NoSQL database.

<b> Why Mongo? </b>
<li> Flexible!
<li> Speed - efficient indexing/storage techniques
<li> Scalability
<li> Querying

<b> Space: </b>

Because Mongo dynamically allocates and de-allocates RAM, it can be run on a small amount of RAM.

-> Stores data in BSON structure, which is stored in a collection.<br>
