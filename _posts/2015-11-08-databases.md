<h3> Introduction: </h3>

Before delving into the details of different database technologies, it's important that we go over the very definition of what a database even is. 

Without even knowing it, you use databases all the time. For every search, ____, or ____, you're likely engaging with a database - you just don't know it because web developers have hid it behind some fancy user interface. 

<h3> Part 1: NoSQL vs SQL</h3>

<b> NoSQL: </b> 
<li> "Not only" SQL
<li> stores data in more than just tabular relations

Types of NoSQL databases:
<li> Document Oriented (Mongo!)
<li> Key Value
<li> Graph
<li> Column Oriented

<b> SQL: </b>
<li> Strictly relational

------------------------------
<h3> Part 2: MongoDB </h3>

<b> Why Mongo? </b>
<li> Flexible!
<li> Speed - efficient indexing/storage techniques
<li> Scalability
<li> Querying

<b> Space: </b>

Because Mongo dynamically allocates and de-allocates RAM, it can be run on a small amount of RAM.

-> Stores data in BSON structure, which is stored in a collection.<br>
