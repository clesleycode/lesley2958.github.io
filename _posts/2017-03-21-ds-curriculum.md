title: Open Sourcing Data Science Curriculum
tags: datascience education
categories: datascience education

Before I was an undergraduate student, I relied almost exclusively on resources provided to me for free. My education flourished because of <i>free</i> resources like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) & [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/). I can't even begin to emphasize the importance of accessibility for students of all backgrounds. 

It's with this in mind that I open source the Data Science Curriculum I've created over the past year. I want to note that not every guide is complete and sometimes contain overlapping information -- if you have any change suggestions, feel free to fork and contribute or submit a github issue!
