Before I was an undergraduate student, I relied almost exclusively on resources provided to me for free. My education flourished because of <i>free</i> resources like [Khan Academy(khanacademy.com) & [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/). I can't even begin to emphasize the importance of accessibility for students of all backgrounds. It's with this in mind that I open source the Data Science Curriculum I've created over the past year.
