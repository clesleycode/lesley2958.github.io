<h2> Getting Started with Natural Language Processing </h2>

<h3> Pre-requisites: </h3>

This post assumed some knowledge of Python.

First, install the nltk module:

``` bash
$ pip install nltk
```
<h3> What is Natural Language Processing? </h3>

Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is an area of computer science that focuses on developing techniques used to produce machine-driven analyses of text.

<h3> Why is NLP important? </h3>

NLP expands the sheer amount of data that can be used for insight purposes, since so much of the data we have available is in the form of text.

A specific common application of NLP is each time you use a language conversion tool. The techniques used to accurately convert text from one language to another very much falls under the umbrella of "natural language processing."

<h3> Why is NLP a "hard" problem? </h3>

Language is inheritantly ambiguous. Once person's interpretation of a sentence may very well differ from another person's interpretation. Because of this inability to consistantly be clear, there are no perfect NLP techniques. 

<h3> Regular Expressions: </h3>

``` bash
$ pip install re
```

<h3> Writing your first script: </h3>

``` python
import nltk
```
