    "I have been blogging for close to ten years now. I started off with Wordpress back in 2009 and continued using it for 5 years. IPython notebook had become very popular by then and I moved towards Pelican and hosted my blog cum website on Github. Jake Vanderplas and others had put a lot of effort in customising Pelican and adding IPython notebook support. While everything worked well, over time, Pelican started appealing less to me. The builds got slower as I added more posts. Git history would grow crazy as the blog would be regenerated. I looked into alternative blogging engines like Jekyll, which would probably have similar issues? While Medium.com allows linking Jupyter notebook gists, they appear IFramed. I thought: what if I could use `nbconvert` utility provided by the awesome folks at Jupyter and create a simplish blog- no hassle, no pagination, plain Python code!"
